Problem
===
In a building, there are eight meeting rooms, which are shared by 10 departments on an as-needed basis. Each department has a secretary who is responsible for resvering meeting rooms. Each resvervation slot is of 1 h duration, and rooms can only be resverved between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Your job is to implement a shared room revervation schedule that can be used by the secretary.<br>
Use the following conflict resolution rule: If multiple appointments overlap, the earliest entry for that slot revails and others are cancelled. If there is a tie for the earliest entry, the secretaries' first names will be used to break the tie. Each secretary will work on a separeate replica of the schedule and enter the reservation request stamped by the clock time. The clocks are synchronized. Dependency checks will be done during the antientropy sessions as in Bayou. The goal is eventual consistency.<br>
